# # 🍎🍊 Apples vs. Oranges Image Classifier
A deep learning CNN that classifies apples and oranges using TensorFlow/Keras. Trained in Colab, deployable in VS Code.

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project is a deep learning image classification model built with TensorFlow/Keras that distinguishes between images of apples and oranges. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture trained on a labeled dataset sourced via Kagglehub. The model is developed and trained in Google Colab and is exportable to VS Code for further testing or deployment.
